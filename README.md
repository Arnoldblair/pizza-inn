## Description
* A pizza ordering web application

## PROJECT BEHAVIOUR

* The app Determines the prices for each pizza size.
  * The app  Determines the cost for each crust since each pizza topping has a set value depending on the size of the pizza.
* On checkout, the application displays the ordersâ€™ summary together with the total amount charged. For example, if the customer has made more than one pizza order, on checkout the application displays a summary of all the orders he/she has made and the total amount to pay for all his/her orders.
